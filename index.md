Machine translation (MT), the task of automatically translating text in one language, into text in another language using a computer system, has undergone many shifts since its inception in the late 1950s. The latest of which, neural machine translation (NMT), has reached unprecedented translation qualities at almost human-level performance, of course for some use-cases and under certain conditions.

MT has become an indispensable tool for professional translators (to assist in the translation workflow), for commercial users, e.g. e-commerce companies (to make their content quickly available in multiple languages), to every-day users (to access information unrestricted by the language in which it is produced). But what is the real added value of MT? What are its impacts on environment and society? How good can it become? And how does data and models reflect language? are among the questions that are addressed within the Inclusive and Sustainable MT research line at CSAI, Tilburg University.
